Project Name - Hervibes

Description
This project is a "Health & Wellness" web application designed to support the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of girls and students. The application allows users to track menstrual health, provides tips, predictions, and encourages a healthy lifestyle. The goal of this app is to help users maintain a balanced and healthy routine by offering accessible resources and easy-to-use tools.



Why I Selected This Topic

I selected the "Health & Wellness" theme because women's health, both physical and mental, is often overlooked in traditional spaces. Building a tool that helps young women track their menstrual health and offers tips and resources for managing it can empower them to take better control of their well-being. This is especially important for students and girls, who often struggle to access proper health information or tools to manage their menstrual cycle.
